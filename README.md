# codeforces
Repo containing solutions to selected codeforces problems, by problem numbers

### Structure:
Problems are first sorted into folders based on Division and then based on
difficulty. All the contests that I give will contain solutions in the form
round[round-number] within the respective division.

### Note:
WIP, I am currently practicing problems and uploading the code as I go. The
same applies to contests as well.
